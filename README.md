# local-llm-server

This repository provisions a **dedicated Mac mini** as a **stable, reproducible local LLM host**.

It is designed for long-term maintenance: safe upgrades, explicit model management, and clear separation between **host provisioning (Ansible)** and **service deployment (Docker containers)**.
